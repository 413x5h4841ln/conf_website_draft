# Welcome to StatistiCon 2025!

Have you ever been to a conference and gone home a little confused? Did you have the urge to socialise, but the professionalism of the event intimidated you? Did you like the concept but also get a bit lost?

Especially for students, for non-PhDs, for people who haven't been working in the industry for years, conferences can be a bit overwhelming. StatistiCon aims to address these people. We want to provide an event where attendees should not be scared to ask questions and presenters should not be embarrassed if they donâ€™t have a perfect answer. We want to provide inspiration and connection for free, to everybody who is interested.
